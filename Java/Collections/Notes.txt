====================================>> Collections Framework <<==================================================

==> The Collection is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.
    Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, 
    insertion, manipulation, and deletion.

    Interfaces and Classe: 
                Iterable                                            ---- Extends
                |--> List ==>{ArrayList, LinkedList, vector}        ==== Implements
                |--> Set  ==>{HashSet, LinkedHashSet} 
                |         ---> SortedSet ====>{TreeSet}
                |--> Queue --> Deque ==>{ArrayQueue}

==> Collection Methods

    -->boolean add(E element)                           boolean removeAll(Collection<?> c)
    boolean remove(Object o)                            boolean retainAll(Collection<?> c)
    boolean contains(Object o)                          Object[] toArray()
    public boolean containsAll(Collection<?> c)         clear()
    int size()
    boolean isEmpty()

==> Iterator Interfaces

    Iterator interface provides the facility of iterating the elements in a forward direction only.
    There are only three methods in the Iterator Interface:-
        public boolean hasNext() -	It returns true if the iterator has more elements otherwise it returns false.
        public Object next()	 -  It returns the element and moves the cursor pointer to the next element.
        public void remove()	 -  It removes the last elements returned by the iterator. It is less used.

        Iterator<Integer> roll= al.iterator();          // Creating Iterator Object which holds Integer type obj
        while(roll.hasNext()){               
            int toPrint= roll.next();                   //using hasNext()
            System.out.print(toPrint+ " ");
            if(toPrint==0){
                roll.remove();                         //using remove() method
            }
       }    

==> ArrayList               

    Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements.
    The ArrayList in Java can have the duplicate elements also.
    Java ArrayList class maintains insertion order.
    Java ArrayList allows random access because the array works on an index basis. 
    It is like an array, but there is no size limit. 
    We can add or remove elements anytime. 
    So, it is much more flexible than the traditional array. 
    It is found in the java.util package.
    We can not create an array list of the primitive types, such as int, float, char, etc. 
    It is required to use the required wrapper class in such cases. 

    By ListIterator interface, we can iterate the ArrayList in reverse order.

==> LinkedList

    Java LinkedList class uses a doubly linked list to store the elements. 
    It provides a linked-list data structure. 
    It inherits the AbstractList class and implements List and Deque interfaces.
    Java LinkedList class is non synchronized.
    In Java LinkedList class, manipulation is fast because no shifting needs to occur.

    Here are some of the most commonly used methods explicitly available in the LinkedList class:

        addFirst(E element):    Adds the specified element to the beginning of the list.
        addLast(E element):     Adds the specified element to the end of the list.
        removeFirst():          Removes and returns the first element in the list.
        removeLast():           Removes and returns the last element in the list.
        getFirst():             Returns the first element in the list without removing it.
        getLast():              Returns the last element in the list without removing it.
        offerFirst(E element):  Adds the specified element to the beginning of the list, returning true if successful.
        offerLast(E element):   Adds the specified element to the end of the list, returning true if successful.
        removeFirstOccurence("e"):      Remove first occurrence of element from the list  
        removeLastOccurence("e"):       Remove last occurrence of element from the list
