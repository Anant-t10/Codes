==> static
    We can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes. 
    The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.
    
    The static can be:
        Variable (also known as a class variable)
        Method (also known as a class method)
        Block

    Without static:
        class Student{                  //Example of code without static keyword
            int rollno;  
            String name;  
            String college="ITS";  
        }  
    
    A static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.

    a static block is a special block of code that runs when the class is loaded into the 
    memory by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). These static blocks are also known as static initializers.

    "this" can be passed as an argument in the method call.
    "this" can be used to refer current class instance variable.

==> Inheritence

    Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java through class.
    Super Constructor of the parent class is called first whenever the child is created. 


==> Polymorphism:-
    
    > Method Overloading

        In Java, Method Overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the method only.
        There are two ways to overload the method in java:-
            By changing number of arguments
            By changing the data type
        Compile Time Error is better than Run Time Error. 
        So, java compiler renders compiler time error if you declare the same method having same parameters.
    
    > Method Overriding

        If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java.
        If a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared by one of its parent class, 
        it is known as method overriding.

        The method must have the same name as in the parent class
        The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
