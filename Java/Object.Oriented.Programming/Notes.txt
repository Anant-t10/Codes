==> static
    We can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes. 
    The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.
    
    The static can be:
        Variable (also known as a class variable)
        Method (also known as a class method)
        Block
        Nested class

    Without static:
        class Student{                  //Example of code without static keyword
            int rollno;  
            String name;  
            String college="ITS";  
        }  
    
    A static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.

    a static block is a special block of code that runs when the class is loaded into the 
    memory by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). These static blocks are also known as static initializers.

    "this" can be passed as an argument in the method call.
    "this" can be used to refer current class instance variable.

==> Inheritence

    Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java through class.


==> Polymorphism:-
    
    > Method Overloading

        In Java, Method Overloading is not possible by changing the return type of the method only.
        There are two ways to overload the method in java:-
            By changing number of arguments
            By changing the data type
        Compile Time Error is better than Run Time Error. 
        So, java compiler renders compiler time error if you declare the same method having same parameters.
